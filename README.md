# 2DPhysicsEngine

This engine is a lightweight 2D physics engine for games, simulations, and interactive applications.  
It handles rigid-body dynamics, collision detection, and collision response, and is designed to be easy to integrate into existing projects.

## ✨ Features

- Rigid body dynamics (static, kinematic, dynamic bodies)
- Basic shapes: circles, boxes, polygons
- Broadphase + narrowphase collision detection
- Collision response: impulses, friction, restitution
- Fixed time-step simulation
- Simple API for integrating with any rendering engine
